# Problem Solving

I will challenge myself with Programming Problems from Codeforces, Hackerrank, Leetcode etc and put my solutions for them in this repository with problem link and descriptions

## Purpose

- To enhance my own problem-solving skills with programming
- Familiarize myself with different data structure & algorithms
- Try out solving same problem in different languages to get to know inner workings of those languages

## Methodology

- First I will try to form a brute force solution in my mind
- I will try to find an algorithm or a special data structure suited for the task
- I will try to modify an algorithm to my need to solve the task
